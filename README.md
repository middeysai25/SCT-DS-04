🗺️ Task 04: Traffic Accident Pattern Analysis
Goal: Analyze road safety data to find accident hotspots based on time and weather.

Dataset: US Traffic Accident Data (2023-2024).

Methodology: * Temporal Analysis: Heatmaps to identify peak accident hours (Rush Hour).

Spatial Analysis: Folium-based maps to plot coordinate data.

Key Insight: Most accidents occurred between 4 PM and 7 PM on weekdays, even in clear weather conditions, suggesting traffic volume is a higher risk factor than weather.
